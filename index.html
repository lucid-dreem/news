    <h1>US election 2020: Trump in three-state campaign blitz after casting vote</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p><b>President Donald Trump has conducted a three-state campaign blitz after voting early in Florida.</b></p>
    <p>He hopped between rallies in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin on Saturday <span>as he sought to make up ground</span> against his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.</p>
    <p>Mr Biden<span>, who holds a steady lead in national polls,</span> campaigned in Pennsylvania, another key state.</p>
    <p>Some 57 million votes have already been cast, a record spurred by the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The Republican president has continued to hold packed rallies <span>despite a new surge</span> in <span>coronavirus infections that is particularly affecting</span> the Midwest <span>- home to several electoral battlegrounds</span> that could decide the election.</p>
    <p>Speaking in Lumberton, North Carolina, Mr Trump said America's coronavirus epidemic had been blown out of proportion and mocked his Democratic rival for making ominous warnings about a bleak winter.</p>
    <p>In contrast, Mr Biden held a drive-in rally in Bristol, Pennsylvania where he told supporters: "We don't want to become superspreaders."</p>
    <p>Meanwhile <span>the chief of staff for</span> Vice-President Mike Pence has tested positive for Covid-19 <span>but Mr Pence and his wife have tested negative</span>, a spokesperson said. They plan to continue their busy campaign schedule despite Mr Pence being <span>a close contact of an</span> infected <span>person</span>.</p>
    <p>With just 10 days to go until the November 3 election, Joe Biden holds an average eight-point lead in national polls over Donald Trump.</p>
    <p>But the race is much closer in several important swing states.</p>

    <h2>Where are the campaigns targeting?</h2>

    <p>Most US states lean heavily towards one party or the other, so presidential candidates usually focus on a dozen or so "battleground" states where either of them could win.</p>
    <p>States like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina are viewed as the most <span>influential because they have</span> historically swung between Republican and Democrat candidates. They also have high numbers of electoral college votes, which decide the outcome of the election.</p>
    <p>After his three-state blitz on Saturday, including a late-night appearance in Waukesha, Wisconsin, the president will appear in New Hampshire <span>on Sunday.</span></p>
    <p><span>He is then scheduled to appear at two rallies in Pennsylvania</span> on Monday, before making his way to Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>Mr Biden <span>only</span> has a <span>narrow</span> lead over Mr Trump in <span>key battlegrounds, with</span> Florida and North Carolina <span>looking particularly tight</span>, according to polling averages.</p>
    <p>The Biden campaign focused on Pennsylvania on Saturday - holding two <span>drive-in</span> rallies there.</p>
    <p>The Democrats won Pennsylvania in every presidential election from 1992-2012 but Mr Trump took the state by a 0.7% margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>
    <p>Reflecting the importance of the Rust Belt state, Mr Biden, who was born there, told supporters: "It may come down to Pennsylvania. And I believe in you. I believe in my state."</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama has been campaigning for Mr Biden <span>in Florida</span>.</p>

    <h2>How and where did Trump vote?</h2>

    <p>Mr Trump voted at a library in West Palm Beach, Florida <span>- near his Mar-a-Lago resort -</span> on Saturday morning.</p>
    <p>"I voted for a guy named Trump," he told reporters after casting his ballot.</p>
    <p>Florida is always a key prize in the US election and the president had been campaigning there on Friday.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump switched his permanent residence and voter registration from New York to Florida last year - and this was the first ballot he has cast in person since doing so. <span>Earlier this year, he voted by mail in the state's primary elections.</span></p>
    <p>During his bid for a second presidential term, Trump has regularly claimed mail-in voting is prone to fraud.</p>
    <p>After casting his vote on Saturday, he said it was "a very secure vote, much more secure than when you send in a ballot". <span>But experts say this is wrong and that there is no evidence to support a link between postal voting and fraud.</span></p>
    <p>More than 3<span>9</span> million people have voted by mail so far, while close to 18 million have voted in person, according to a tally by the United States Election Project.</p>

    <h2>How is coronavirus impacting the election?</h2>

    <p>America's coronavirus outbreak has become a key policy battleground ahead of the November election. It has also contributed to the surge in postal voting.</p>
    <p>On Friday, <span>coronavirus cases hit a record daily high in the US, as</span> states grappled with a new wave of infections. More than <span>8.</span>5 million infections have been reported nationwide, along with nearly 217,000 deaths, according to a tally by the Covid Tracking Project.</p>
    <p>President Donald Trump and Joe Biden clashed over the subject during Thursday's presidential debate, and the two candidates have continued to present starkly different views over the way ahead.</p>
    <p>In North Carolina on Saturday, the president said that widespread coronavirus testing was "good" but <span>also "very foolish" because it boosted case numbers around the country. He</span> also claimed the US might already have a vaccine <span>"if it weren't for politics"</span>.</p>
    <p><span>Despite the current spike in cases and rising hospital admissions,</span> President Trump continued to assure supporters that the US was turning a corner.</p>
    <p>He also mocked his rival's drive-in rallies, which he had seen on TV<span>, saying: "There were so few cars... you could hear the cars: honk honk</span>.<span>"</span></p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Mr Biden maintained his key message that <span>huge numbers of</span> Americans have died from Covid-19 due to the president's policies.</p>
    <p>"It's going to be a dark winter ahead unless we change our ways," he told supporters in Bristol.</p>
    <p>Vice-President Pence took part in rallies in Florida on Saturday despite <span>his chief of staff, Marc Short,</span> testing positive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He is the second <span>top Pence aide</span> to test positive this week, US media reports, raising questions about White House Covid-19 protocol <span>three weeks</span> after President Trump was admitted to hospital with the virus before making a recovery.</p>
